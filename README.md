# Macohi

Bunch o shit I'll prob use in multiple projects

## Command shit

### Install

Go to source : `cd source`

Add this : `git submodule add https://github.com/sphis-sinco/macohi`

Go back From Source : `cd ..`

### General

Update : `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Other ways of using

Just fukin download the zip and drop it in your haxeflixel project lol

## Notes

### Timestamps

For the timestamps I use an extension : "Write Timestamp" (gieson.writetimestamp)
I have C list set to custom and B custom format to "y-mm-dd"

So yuh

# Other shit

## I'm getting errors about missing classes!

If you're just editing this manually to add your own shit and it's not detecting your haxelib shit thats cause this isn't a proper haxeflixel project and your not in one probably so run `.\install.bat` and it'll be fine cause you have the libs and theres `main.hxml` which tells whatever ur using "use these libs bruv"
